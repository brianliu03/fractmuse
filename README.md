## An algorithmic compositional tool for musicians

This project functions as another "tool" composers can use in their creative process. I introduce ways to iteratively expand motifs, sieve theory (from Xenakis), and markov chains.

## Future Work
Detecting chord progressions
Allow users to create mappings of certain notes or chord progressions they like
